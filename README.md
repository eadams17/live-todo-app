# PapPiper Challenge

A small todo app that allows users to add, update and delete todos across teams in real time.

## Setup

1. Run `yarn run setup`
2. Run `yarn start`

The app should now be accessible from `http://localhost:3000/`

To run tests, run `yarn test` in a separate terminal.

## Overview

This application uses **React** on the frontend and **Socket**/**Express** on the backend. The client can emit actions (`add`, `update`, `delete`, `updateAll`, `deleteAll`) to interact with the socket server. The socket server processes these actions and updates the "database", and then sends a response back to the client. The todos are stored in the "database" hash like so:

```
"8d9f99c1-9873-4db3-9ab5-5c88acd09efd": {
    "uuid": "8d9f99c1-9873-4db3-9ab5-5c88acd09efd",
    "title": "Fazer um rolÃª",
    "completed": false
  }
}
```

## Technology

I chose to use **React** (specifically bootsrapped with `create-react-app`) for building out the UI. I chose **React** because it's fast, well-documented and I love the component structure. For styling, I decided to use `CSS Modules`. I like that all styles are scoped locally, helping to keep things more organized. As for testing, I used `Enzyme` and `Jest` for the frontend and `Mocha` for the backend. Since the backend was already setup with **Socket**, I connected it with **Express** to build the server. I added several dependencies across the stack for setting up tests and enhancing the dev experience.

## Optimizations & Considerations

Given more time (and if this were to be scaled out), I would have opted to build out the frontend with my own configuration via **Webpack** for more flexibility in function. I would have also liked to have added a photo roulette for the background image to add some variety (--ok... and also to have the chance to show off some more of my photography ðŸ˜›).

Additionally, I would have added some more styling features. Recently, I've been dabbling with **React-Spring** which offers the ability to build out some pretty cool animations and transitions. I think that I also would have used **Bootstrap** as well in order to make the application totally responsive.
